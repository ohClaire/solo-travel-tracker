Travel Tracker is a useful application for the user to view their previous and upcoming trips booked with a fictictitious travel agency. The user can submit trip request to this agency hence the pending trips. This application will keep track of their travel expenditures and provide estimates for the trip they are requesting. 

## About The Project
The Travel Tracker was assigned in week 10 of the Turing School of Software and Design front-end engineering program. The goals of this group project were to:   
* Use Object-Oriented Programming to drive application design
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
* Create a _robust test suite_ to test all functionality

Other features I want to highlight:         
* Accessibility: app is fully _tabbable_, and scored 100% on both Lighthouse and WAVE audits         
* Functions follow the single responsibility principle (SRP)     
* Clean, attractive design     
* Error handling: form validation, clear error and confirmation messaging

## Getting Started

### Installation
<ol>
  <li>Fork this Repo</li>
  <li>Clone it down to your machine</li>
  <li>cd into the root of the project directory</li>
  <li>run npm install</li>
  <li>To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal to start the local server. You will see a bunch of lines output to your terminal. One of those lines will be something like: Project is running at http://localhost:8080/.</li>
  <li>Go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser to view the code running in the browser.</li>
  <li>Enter control + c in your terminal to stop the local server at any time.</li>
  <li>You will also need to clone down this local api server: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api outside of the Travel Fox directory, follow the installation instructions, and have it running in a separate tab in your terminal each time you run the client.</li>
</ol>
